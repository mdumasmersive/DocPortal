        <h1>Monitor Your Deployment</h1>
        <p>By monitoring your deployment, Solstice Cloud can alert you to any technical issues so they can be resolved before impacting meeting productivity. To help keep track of the status of large deployments, Solstice Cloud gives you a way to quickly identify which Pods have become offline so that any issues can be resolved. Email alert configurations allow you to set up email alerts that are triggered by events such as when a display is unreachable, or when a display is rebooted. These alerts allow you to passively keep tabs on your deployment to resolve issues before they impact your meetings.</p>
        <p>Additionally, Solstice Cloud also allows you to quickly see which Pods in your deployment have an expired Solstice Subscription, and gives you the option to request subscription renewal within the portal to streamline the process. </p>

                <p><a name="ConfigureEmailAlerts"></a>The Solstice Cloud portal allows you to configure automated email alerts if certain events occur, such as a Pod going offline. These alerts can be set to match the needs of your deployment and allow you to quickly detect and resolve issues.</p>
                <p class="tip">You can set up email alerts to go to certain email addresses by assigning specific Pods to a category and then configuring email alerts for that category.  For example, you could assign all the Pods at your Seattle headquarters to a category option for that location. Then, you could configure an email alert to be sent to your IT administrator based in that office if there are technical issues with any of those Pods.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>In the left sidebar menu of the Solstice Cloud portal, go to <b>Monitor</b> &gt; <b>Alerts</b>.</li>
                    <li>Under Alert Configuration, toggle the email alerts you wish to receive to enabled. The toggle switch will turn blue.</li>
                    <li>To only receive email alerts for a select group of displays:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Click <b>filter</b><![CDATA[  ]]><img src="../Resources/Images/i_kepler_filter.png"></img> next to the corresponding email alert.

                <p>Data will only be exported for Pods that currently match your search or filter criteria. This will include both the Pods displayed on the current page as well as Pods contained on additional pages that may not be currently displayed on the screen. For example, if your table is set to display 25 items per page, but there are 30 pods in the list, data for the five currently undisplayed pods will be exported. Additionally only the columns that are currently displayed—that is, columns selected from the Manage Column check-boxes—will be exported.</p>
                <p>When the table shows all the Pods and columns you want to export, click <b>Export to CSV</b>.</p>
                <p>For example, to display all the data for all the Pods:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Clear all filters by clicking the <img src="../Resources/Images/AnalyticsSearchClearX.png" /> in any search fields or on any filter labels.</li>
                    <li>At the bottom of the screen, click <b>Export to CSV</b>.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Your browser should download the CSV file to its downloads directory.</p>
