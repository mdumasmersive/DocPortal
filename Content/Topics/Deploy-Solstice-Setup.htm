        <h1>Solstice Setup</h1>
        <p>The Solstice Pod leverages existing TCP/IP-based networking. Since the Solstice Pod is a network-attached device, IT administration and Network Security should be involved in designing an appropriate deployment. </p>
        <h2>System Components</h2>
        <p>Physical setup and configuration of a Solstice-enabled room is straightforward. The system only requires a few components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Solstice Pods.</b> The Solstice Pod is a network attached wireless collaboration device that is connected to up to two display monitors. The Gen3 Pod supports HDMI output at up to 4K to a single display monitor (use outer HDMI 2 port), or 1080p to two displays. Mersive recommends attaching the Pod to the primary network via standard Ethernet, and can be attached to a secondary network wirelessly. The Pod can be powered by either PoE+ or a Mersive power supply (ordered separately).<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly"> For full hardware specs, see <a href="General-Gen3-Pod-Specs.htm">Gen3 Pod Specs</a>. </MadCap:conditionalText></li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Default.Future"><b>Optional:&#160;USB room camera and/or USB&#160;microphone.</b> To enable your Solstice room to support video conferences, you can attach a USB room camera and/or microphone to the Solstice Pod. </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>User devices.</b> These devices are brought to the room by users attending the collaboration session and are used to share content to the Solstice display, or to get a Solstice conferencing session started.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Solstice app.</b> The Solstice app is installed on user devices and is used to share and control on the Solstice display. The Solstice app can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.mersive.com/download">mersive.com/download</a> for Windows and macOS devices, or from the respective app store for iOS and Android devices. It can also be deployed centrally for Windows devices using the&#160;<a href="Admin-MSI-Instuctions.htm">MSI</a> installer (see <MadCap:xref href="Admin-MSI-Instuctions.htm">Deploy the Solstice App with MSI</MadCap:xref>). If users are unable to install the app on their device, there are multiple app-free sharing options supported such as AirPlay, Miracast, or wired HDMI input. Browser-based sharing is also available and supported for Chromebook, Windows, macOS, and Linux devices. However, the Solstice app is required for features such as layout control, wireless annotation (smartphones only),<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.Future"> web conference support,</MadCap:conditionalText> and more. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>System Requirements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The display monitor must be directly connected to a Solstice Pod through an HDMI video cable.</li>
            <li>The network(s) that Solstice is ultimately deployed on needs to allow peer-to-peer TCP connections. </li>
            <li>The necessary network ports need to be open. For example, ports 80 and 443 will need to be opened for Solstice to access the licensing server and software upgrades. You will also need to open up additional network ports for certain features to work. For more information, see <a href="Admin-Network-Ports.htm" MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly">Open Network Ports</a><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly"><a href="http://documentation.mersive.com/content/topics/admin-network-ports.htm" target="_blank">Open&#160;Network Ports</a></MadCap:conditionalText>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Pod Physical Installation Guidelines</h2>
        <p>Because the Pod does not store user credential information, unencrypted passwords, or users’ data that has been shared to the display, the physical Pods do not have to be located in secure locations. However, other considerations related to theft and environmental conditions should be considered.
</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Select an appropriate physical mounting solution for the Pod that cannot be detached. Consider the use of mounting locks and/or hidden VESA mounting systems behind the display. Specific mounting orientation is not an important factor as the Pod is operational in any orientation.
</li>
            <li>Ensure that appropriate environmental controls have been taken into account. The device should operate within an ambient temperature range of 0° C (32° F) to 50° C (122° F). This may require ventilation or active airflow.  Solstice Pods should never be stacked on top of each other.
</li>
            <li>The Pod should not be mounted in direct contact with a surface that exceeds 30° C (86° F).</li>
            <li>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Network Diagram</h2>

        </p>
        <p class="note">In the network diagram above, only encrypted licensing and configuration data flows from the Pod to the cloud. The encrypted network traffic from shared content never leaves your local network. </p>
        <h2>Best Practices</h2>
        <p>Below are some best practices that should be taken into account or performed before deploying Solstice.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For security-conscious environments, initial configurations for each of your Pods should take place on a standalone network prior to being deployed on your enterprise network. This will ensure that your Pods are configured to be secure before being attached to your network. </li>
            <li>You may need to make firewall exceptions for:<ul><li> Software updates, default RSS feed, default digital signage feed: https://www.mersive.com </li><li>Licensing: https://manager.flexnetoperations.com/service/snetmgr/services/SubscribeNet</li><li>Solstice Cloud portal: Kepler.mersive.com, kepler-backend.mersive.com, kepler-auth.mersive.com, kepler-auth-svc.mersive.com, kepler-onboarding.mersive.com</li><li>In order to detect captive portals, Solstice may periodically attempt to connect to http://clients3.google.com/generate_204</li></ul></li>
            <li>If you utilize an MDM&#160;service, you will need to whitelist the Solstice App. </li>
        </ul>
